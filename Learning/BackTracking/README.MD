# Backtracking

is algorithm for Finding All (or Some) Possible Solutions

### Backtrack

as soon as it Determine that the candidate cannot Lead to **Valid Solution** so we're **Stop Here**

### The Difference Between Backtrack & DFS

- DFS Determine only one Possible Solution
- Backtrack find multiple Solutions for the problem

### Backtrack Simulation

as it's a tree of Solutions and detemine if this solution is Valid or Not
