# Binary Tree

In the introduction, we have gone through the concept of a tree and a binary tree.

In this chapter, we will focus on the traversal methods used in a binary tree. Understanding these traversal methods will definitely help you have a better understanding of the tree structure and have a solid foundation for the further study.

The goal of this chapter is to:

- Understand the difference between different tree traversal methods;
- Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal recursively;
- Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal iteratively;
- Be able to do level traversal using BFS.
